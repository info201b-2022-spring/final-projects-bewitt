**Heart Health**

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

- We are interested in this domain because one of our group mates, Jake, is a bio medical engineer who could offer some expertise on the subject of heart health. 

**What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**

**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**

- We found some data sets on heart disease and heart failure that we thought would be interesting to analyze. Therefore, some questions we have about this domain are: (1) Is there a certain age group more at risk for heart disease? (2) Is there any underlying correlation between sex and heart disease? (3) What locations seem to have the highest proportion of people with heart disease at cause of death (city vs. rural, population size, etc.)?

1. U.S. State Life Expectancy by Sex, 2018

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**
- This data set was downloaded [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-state-life-expectancy-by-sex-2018)

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
- This data was collected by the National Center for Health Statistics who operated under the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. It compiles life expectancy at birth estimates for all states and seperates them based on sex (male and female), using the data available in 2018. 

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
- This dataset has 157 observations (rows).

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**
- This dataset has 5 features (columns).

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**
- What is the relationship between age and life expectancy?
- Is there a correlation between life expectancy and sex?

2. Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**
-This data set was downloaded from: [This](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

This data set was taken from the CDC and is an entirely American database.  It pulls from hospitals around the United States and originally had 300 columns of data.  The one we chose has been trimmed to only have 18 variable and aroound 400,000 pieces of data. 


**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

319,796

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

18

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

This data set could answer what age groups are most affected by heart disease and the correlation between sex and heat disease risk

3. Heart Failure Prediction Dataset

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**
- This data set was downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**
- This data was generated by combining datasets already available independently. Five independent heart datasets were combined from research completed by the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, University Hospital in Zurich, University Hospital in Basel, and V.A. Medical Center in Long Beach and Cleveland. The data covers risk factors for heart disease related to patients staying at these hospitals and medical centers.

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
- The combined data set has 918 total observations (rows).

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**
- The combined data set has 12 total features (columns).

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**
- How does serum cholesterol level affect the chance of a person developing heart disease?
- How does resting blood pressure affect the chance of a person developing heart disease?
- How does age affect the chance of a person developing heart disease?
