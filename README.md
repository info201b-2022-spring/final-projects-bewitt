Why are you interested in this field/domain?

We are interested in this domain because one of our group mates, Jake, is a bio medical engineer who could offer some expertise on the subject. 

What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?



What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

We found some data sets on heart disease and heart failure that we though would be interesting to analyze. Therefore, some questions we have about this domain are: (1) Is there a certain age group more at risk for heart disease? (2) Is there any underlying correlation between sex and heart disease? (3) What locations seem to have the highest proportion of people with heart disease at cause of death (city vs. rural, population size, etc.)?
